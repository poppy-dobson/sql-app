# database-help
an application to support ijc212 students with their exam preparation :) 

i haven't planned it fully yet, but i think this project will likely be:
- a web app made with streamlit (or possibly flask or something if I'm feeling fancy)
- where students can upload their database (or import/write its schema) (or connect to it)
- and be quizzed on the sorts of sql queries featured in the exam (aggregation, joins, subqueries, double not exists, views, transactions, etc etc), with questions generated by an llm which can understand their schema and its potential real-world context
- could also potentially be an explanation mode / page, either llm powered or not, to help explain queries or data modelling choices
- also also could also do mongodb stuff too, obvs this isnt in the exam but query practice could help
